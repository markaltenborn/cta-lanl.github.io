  bio: "I am a staff R&D Scientist in the Computational Physics and Methods Group (CAI-2) at Los Alamos National Laboratory. I have broad scientific interests, but find myself drawn to solving some of Nature's most complex problems on some of Earth's biggest computers. This interest first developed while I earned B.S. degress in Physics and in Space Sciences at Florida Institute of Technology. I followed this pursuit in my Ph.D. work in astrophysics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as a NASA Earth and Space Science Fellow, then as a postdoc at Princeton University before coming to LANL as a Nicholas C. Metropolis Fellow."

In 2005 she was hired into a staff R&D Scientist position in LANL's Computer and Computational Sciences (CCS) Division. She has remained at LANL since that time and has served in a variety of technical leadership roles across CCS, X-Theoretical Design and X-Computational Physics divisions. Her technical expertise includes astrophysics (computational modeling of supernovae), weapons assessment, and multiphysics code development. She has served as project lead for projects in Defense Program's Office of Experimental Sciences (OES), and Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC).

  bio: "I have over five years of experience as a Staff R&D Scientist at LANL, where I apply my skills and knowledge in theoretical nuclear physics to study the fundamental interactions between neutrons and protons in atomic nuclei and neutron stars. I use high-performance computing and machine learning to solve the nuclear many-body problem and to study gravitational waves from neutron-star mergers, which are one of the most exciting phenomena in modern astrophysics. I am passionate about advancing our understanding of nature and exploring the mysteries of the cosmos."

  bio: "I'm a computational R&D Scientist in the Lagrangian Codes group of the XCP Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory. After obtaining a PhD in Physics in 2017 from the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV), where I was supervised by Daniel Proga, I joined LANL as a postdoc in the Theortical Division, where I worked with Hui Li, Jarrett Johnson, and Joe Smidt. Before returning to LANL in 2022, I spent the entirety of the pandemic back at UNLV, again working in Daniel Proga's group but this time as an aging postdoc."
